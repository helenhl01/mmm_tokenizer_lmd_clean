# Encode MIDI files from the LMD dataset as text tokens.
# WIP

## Tokenize the LMD clean dataset using the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM) representation.

This code was built on top of the [implementation](https://github.com/AI-Guru/MMM-JSB) of [Dr. Tristan Behrens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-tristan-behrens-734967a2/) of the "MMM: Exploring Conditional Multi-Track Music Generation with the Transformer" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06048). The changes to the original code are just a few adaptations so the repo could work with the LMD dataset.

## About.

This repository allows the user to represent the MIDI files from the LMD clean dataset as text tokens, as explained in the paper "MMM: Exploring Conditional Multi-Track Music Generation with the Transformer" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06048). It can be used to create the datasets using the MMMTrack version from the paper.
